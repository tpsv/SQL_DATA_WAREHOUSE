Data Warehouse & Analytics Solution üöÄ

Welcome to the Data Warehouse & Analytics Solution repository! This project demonstrates the implementation of a modern data warehouse alongside powerful analytics workflows, showcasing best practices in data engineering, data warehousing, and business intelligence.

This is a portfolio-driven project designed to highlight the capabilities of building a scalable, efficient, and analytical data infrastructure. The solution encompasses end-to-end workflows from data ingestion to actionable business insights.


üöÄ Project Overview

This project focuses on building a robust data warehousing solution with clear layers and stages, all powered by Medallion Architecture. From raw data ingestion to actionable insights, the repository contains all the elements required for a comprehensive analytics project.

Key Features of the Project:

Data Architecture: Leveraging Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) to structure data flow.

ETL Pipelines: Data extraction, transformation, and loading from raw source systems into an optimized warehouse.

Data Modeling: Building effective fact and dimension tables to support quick, accurate analysis.

Analytics & Reporting: SQL-based reports and dashboards offering business insights and actionable data.

üèóÔ∏è Data Architecture

The architecture follows a Medallion Architecture framework, which breaks the data into three distinct layers:

Bronze Layer: Raw data directly ingested from CSV files into a SQL Server database, unprocessed and unchanged.

Silver Layer: Cleansed, standardized, and normalized data, which is prepared and structured for analysis and reporting.

Gold Layer: Fully transformed business data, organized into a star schema, ready for reporting and high-performance analytics.

This structured architecture ensures that data moves from raw, unfiltered information through to business-ready insights, offering both flexibility and scalability.



üîß Tech Stack

This project utilizes a variety of tools and technologies to build a complete data pipeline:

SQL Server - Relational database used for data storage and management.

ETL Pipelines - Pipelines built for smooth extraction, transformation, and loading of data.

SQL - For creating reports and dashboards based on analytical needs.

Data Modeling - The foundation of dimensional modeling to enable high-performance querying.
